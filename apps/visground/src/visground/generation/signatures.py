    Write executable Python code that builds a visualization object from `df`.

    Rules:
    - Output Python code only in ```python fences. No explanation or comments.
    - Assume the data already exists in a pandas DataFrame named `df`.
    - Do not read files and do not recreate or overwrite `df`.
    - Use only columns present in the provided schema, with exact names.
    - Respect both the analytical intent and the requested chart form in the query.
    - Follow every item in `requirements` strictly. These may include required imports,
      library constraints, design guidance, or output conventions.
    - Assign the final visualization object to a variable named `chart`.
